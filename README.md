# Dr. Bouamara Dental Clinic — website & admin dashboard

A production-grade Next.js application for Dr. Bouamara Dental Clinic: a public
website with a real appointment-request system, plus a custom admin dashboard
for managing appointments, messages and site content.

It started from the MIT-licensed **WhitePearl** dental template (see
[`NOTICE.md`](./NOTICE.md)) — the routing skeleton, Tailwind foundation and a
few layout patterns were kept, while the visual identity, content, architecture,
booking engine, authentication and dashboard are new.

---

## 1. Current status — read this first

The site is a **complete, working clinic website**. Real clinic information was
supplied by the practice and is used everywhere; nothing else was invented —
anything still unknown is a clearly-marked placeholder.

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Public website (6 pages + legal) | ✅ Built, responsive, accessible, builds cleanly |
| Appointment system | ✅ 24/7 availability, real slot generation, conflict detection, validation, persistence |
| Admin dashboard | ✅ Custom, protected, with live KPIs, an hours editor and a readiness report |
| Supabase architecture | ✅ Schema, RLS, constraints, views, seed SQL included (project not created yet) |
| Authentication | ✅ Supabase Auth wired; demo session available for local preview |
| Clinic identity & contact | ✅ Real: name, both phone numbers, WhatsApp, email, Facebook, town (Djelfa), Google Maps link |
| Opening hours | ✅ Real: **24 hours a day, 7 days a week** — editable in the dashboard |
| Logo | ✅ Built-in navy/gold mark + typographic lockup; drop in the artwork files to use the exported logo instead (§8) |
| Photography, practitioner profiles, reviews, legal wording | ⚠️ Labelled placeholders — no stock imagery and no invented content |

Every remaining placeholder is tracked in `src/content/site.ts` → `PLACEHOLDER_FIELDS`
and in `src/content/media.ts`, and is listed in the dashboard
(**Settings → Content still needed**) and on the overview (**Site readiness**).

---

## 2. Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local     # already present in this checkout
npm run dev                    # http://localhost:3000
```

The project runs with **no backend configured**: the public site renders from
typed content files and appointment requests are written to a local demo store
(`.data/`, git-ignored).

### Scripts

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Development server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run start` | Serve the production build |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint (next/core-web-vitals + next/typescript) |
| `npm run check` | Typecheck + lint together |

### Opening the dashboard locally

Without Supabase, the dashboard is **locked by design**. To preview it:

```bash
# .env.local
ADMIN_DEMO_ACCESS="true"
SESSION_SECRET="<any long random string>"
```

Then visit `/admin` → *Open the demo dashboard*. This is a development
convenience with **no real authentication** — never enable it on a deployment
holding real patient data.

```

**Design rule:** server components render content, `lib/services` owns business
logic, `lib/queries` owns data access, and `content/` is the fallback. Swapping a
content file for a database table never requires touching a component.

---

## 4. Design system

| Token | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ink` | `#0B2342` (`900`) → `#4A7396` (`400`) | Deep navy for dark sections, admin sidebar; 15.75:1 on white |
| `brand` | `#1A5788` (50–950 scale) | Refined dental blue; 7.6:1 on white |
| `gold` | `#C2A06B` | Champagne accent — decorative (2.4:1 on white, 6.4:1 on navy) |
| `gold.ink` | `#8A6D3A` | Accessible gold for text (4.85:1 on white) |
| `cream` | `#FAFAF8` | Warm-white page canvas |

There is **no green anywhere** in the palette: deep navy is the primary colour,
dental blue carries actions, warm white is the canvas and champagne gold is used
sparingly for accents (rules, eyebrow ticks, the smile arc in the mark).
| Fonts | Cormorant Garamond (display) + Montserrat (UI/body) | Self-hosted via `@fontsource` — no Google Fonts at build or runtime |
| Motion | CSS reveal utilities + `Reveal` component + Framer Motion for interaction | `prefers-reduced-motion` fully respected |

Component classes live in `globals.css` (`btn-primary`, `card`, `field`,
`eyebrow`, `container-x`, `section`). Contrast was checked with WCAG AA in mind;
see the comment block at the top of `tailwind.config.ts`.

**Accessibility:** skip link, semantic landmarks, labelled form controls with
`aria-invalid`/`aria-describedby`, visible focus rings, `aria-live` status
messages, keyboard-operable menus (Escape to close, body scroll lock), and
no-JS-safe reveals (content is never hidden in the SSR HTML).

---

## 5. Appointment system

Not a fake form — a working engine:

1. **Slot generation** (`lib/booking/slots.ts`, pure and unit-testable): opening
   hours + appointment duration + turnaround produce candidate slots; a slot that
   would run past closing time is never offered.
2. **Availability is 24/7.** The clinic is open every day, around the clock, so
   all 48 half-hour slots of every day are offered. Opening hours are resolved in
   exactly one place — `lib/services/hours.ts` (`getOpeningHours()`) — which reads
   Supabase `opening_hours` when configured, otherwise the local demo store,
   otherwise the typed default in `src/content/site.ts`. The dashboard editor
   (**Admin → Opening hours**) writes to the same source, so nothing is hard-coded
   in any component. `00:00 → 24:00` is the canonical full-day value: it expands
   to 00:00–23:30 and the closing-time guard correctly allows a 23:30 slot.
3. **Rules**: minimum notice (`minimumNoticeHours`, now 1 h — a courtesy buffer,
   not an opening-hours limit), booking horizon (`horizonDays`), closed days
   skipped, lead-time/booked/closure reasons.
4. **Blocking data**: existing `pending`/`confirmed` appointments and clinic
   closures. Patients read only the `appointment_slots` / `time_off_slots`
   **views**, which expose time ranges and no patient data.
5. **Server-side authority**: `checkSlotBookable()` re-validates the requested
   slot at submission. The client is never trusted.
6. **Concurrency**: at the database level an *exclusion constraint* rejects
   overlapping blocking appointments, so two simultaneous requests cannot both
   win. The service maps both `23505` and `23P01` to a friendly message.
7. **Notifications**: patient confirmation + clinic notification via Resend
   (`fetch`, no SDK). Best-effort — a mail failure never loses a booking.
8. **Abuse protection**: Zod validation, per-IP rate limiting, honeypot field.

Time zones are handled with `Intl` (no date library): every instant is stored as
UTC, and all wall-clock values are interpreted in `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLINIC_TIME_ZONE`
(default `Africa/Algiers`).

> **Requests vs bookings:** the site is explicit that submitting a request does
> not reserve a slot until the clinic confirms it.

---

## 6. Admin dashboard

Custom-built (the template had none), at `/admin`:

| Page | Contents |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | Today's count, awaiting confirmation, upcoming 7 days, unread messages, today's schedule, next appointments, **Site readiness** report, operational reminders |
| **Appointments** | Filters by status, grouped by clinic-local day, status updates, staff-only internal notes, patient contact links |
| **Messages** | Contact-form inbox, read/unread toggling, subject badges |
| **Opening hours** | One-click 24/7 preset, per-day open/close editor, closed-day toggles — writes to Supabase `opening_hours` (or the demo store) and takes effect site-wide |
| **Settings & setup** | Live environment status, step-by-step Supabase setup, placeholder inventory, security notes |

Details that matter:

- **Two-layer authorisation.** Middleware performs a cheap redirect; the
  protected layout and every Server Action re-check with `requireStaff()` /
  `getStaffOrNull()`. A Server Action is a public endpoint, so the UI is never
  the gate.
- **Revocable instantly.** Authorisation depends on an *active* row in
  `staff_profiles` — not on JWT claims that keep working until they expire.
- **Progressive enhancement.** Status changes and notes post through plain
  `<form>` elements, so the dashboard still works if JavaScript fails.
- **Honest labelling.** Demo mode is banner-flagged, and sample records are
  marked `sample` in the UI.

---

## 7. Supabase integration

See **[`supabase/README.md`](./supabase/README.md)** for the full setup. In short:
create the project → run `supabase/migrations/0001`–`0004` → create a user → add
its `staff_profiles` row → add the env vars. The site then automatically switches
from content files to the database, and from the demo store to real persistence.

| Migration | Contents |
|---|---|
| `0001_schema.sql` | Enums, 7 tables, indexes, constraints |
| `0002_functions.sql` | `is_staff()`/`is_admin()`, updated-at + audit triggers, **double-booking exclusion constraint**, patient-safe views |
| `0003_rls.sql` | RLS on every table + grants (anon: insert-only on appointments/messages) |
| `0004_seed.sql` | Opening hours (⚠️ demo values) + the 20-treatment catalogue |

Server code uses three clients: browser (anon, RLS), server (cookie-bound), and
an optional service-role client that returns `null` unless configured. Secrets
never reach the browser.

---

## 8. Replacing the placeholders

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| **Logo artwork** | `npm run media:setup` cuts the clinic's logo sheet into `public/brand/logo-light.png`, `logo-dark.png`, `mark-light.png` and `mark-dark.png` (plus the favicon and app icon) and records them in `src/content/media.generated.ts`. Drop the files in by hand and set the same four paths in `src/content/media.ts` to override. Without artwork a built-in navy/gold tooth-and-smile mark plus a typographic lockup is used. |
| Clinic name, tagline, phone, email, WhatsApp, town, Maps link | `src/content/site.ts` |
| Opening hours | **Admin → Opening hours** (or `src/content/site.ts` for the built-in default) |
| **Photographs** | Save files in `public/media/`, then set the path in `src/content/media.ts` — doctor portrait, facility gallery, before/after results, TV-appearance still |
| **TV interview link** | `src/content/sections.ts` → `mediaAppearances[].videoUrl` (currently the clinic's YouTube link, timestamped). The button opens YouTube in a new tab; nothing is embedded |
| Treatments, categories, durations | `src/content/services.ts` |
| Page copy, values, practitioner bio, FAQ, reviews | `src/content/sections.ts` |
| Legal pages | `src/app/legal/[slug]/page.tsx` — placeholder wording, needs review |
| Structured data | `src/app/layout.tsx` — name, email, both phones, town, Maps link and 24/7 hours are already emitted; the street address is added automatically once set |
| Booking policy (notice, horizon, slot step, time zone) | `src/lib/booking/config.ts` |

After adding real content, clear the corresponding entries from
`PLACEHOLDER_FIELDS` — the site readiness panel will reflect it.

**Consent.** Before/after photographs are only rendered for cases flagged
`consentOnFile: true` in `src/content/media.ts`, together with a standing
disclaimer. Keep that flag honest: it is the site's record that documented
patient consent exists.

---

## 9. Deployment hardening

Before going live:

1. Set `ADMIN_DEMO_ACCESS="false"` and a strong `SESSION_SECRET`.
2. Configure Supabase and email (§7).
3. Add `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` (or a CSP `frame-ancestors` directive) at
   the CDN/edge **for the production domain**. It is intentionally omitted from
   `next.config.ts` so the app remains embeddable in preview/host iframes.
4. Review the CSP in `next.config.ts` after adding any third-party script
   (analytics, maps, chat).
5. Enable database backups and set a retention policy for appointments.
6. Point a monitoring service at `/api/health`.
7. Re-run `npm run check` and `npm run build`.

## 10. Licensing & attribution

- **Code:** MIT. This project derives from the WhitePearl template
  (© 2025 R.paco, MIT) — the required attribution is in
  [`NOTICE.md`](./NOTICE.md). Keep it in place.
- **Images:** the template shipped 22 stock photographs (Shutterstock, Adobe
  Stock, Canva) — one carried an explicit *"No use without permission"* notice.
  They were **removed** and are no longer part of this repository. Do not
  reintroduce stock imagery without a licence; see `public/media/README.md` for
  the rights and consent rules that apply to clinic and patient photography.
- **Content:** clinic identity, contact details and 24/7 opening hours were
  supplied by the practice. Everything else is placeholder copy that makes no
  medical, outcome or accreditation claims, and lists no invented practitioners,
  credentials, reviews or awards.

---

## 11. Known limitations / next steps

1. **Create the Supabase project** and run the migrations — the biggest single
   step towards production.
2. **Rate limiting is per-instance** (`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`). On serverless
   hosting, move it to Redis/Upstash; the call sites do not change.
3. **The demo store is not a database.** Without Supabase, data lives in
   `.data/*.json`, is not backed up, and is unsuitable for real patients.
4. **No automated tests yet.** The booking engine is pure and easy to test —
   Vitest is the natural next addition, then Playwright for the booking flow.
5. **Email is unverified** (no API key here). Send a live test once
   `RESEND_API_KEY` exists, and add SPF/DKIM for the sender domain.
6. **Content is English-only.** `clinic.languages` already lists French, Arabic
   and English; adding `next-intl` is the recommended path, plus
   `@fontsource/*-arabic` subsets and RTL support.
7. **Reminders** (SMS/WhatsApp, e.g. 24 h before) are not implemented; a
   `pg_cron` job or Edge Function fits the current schema.
8. **Remaining dashboard CRUD.** Opening hours are editable (**Admin → Opening
   hours**); services, team and media editing are the next milestone — their
   tables and RLS policies already exist. Until then those are edited in
   `src/content/*.ts` and `src/content/media.ts`.
9. **Residual npm advisories** are limited to the build toolchain (Tailwind v3's
   `chokidar`/`braces`/`micromatch`, ESLint plugins). None ship to the runtime;
   the Next.js critical advisories were resolved by the upgrade to 15.5.27.
